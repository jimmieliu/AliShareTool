# AliShareToolEquivalentScript

Recently I received a tool called AliShareTool.exe, but it is reported to be an unsafe program.

After researching about its principle, I wrote an unzip tool by python, and unsuprisingly it worked.

It simply convert xxx.zip.png to xxx.zip, then you can unzip the result file finally.

## Usage:
`python fakepng2zip.py $path_to_file`
